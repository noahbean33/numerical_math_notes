# Comparison: Math for ML Course Codebases

This document summarizes the major differences between the two folders:

- `c:/Users/marin/Desktop/machine_learning/mathematics-of-machine-learning-book-main/`
- `c:/Users/marin/Desktop/machine_learning/ML-foundations-master/`

Both are “math for machine learning” oriented, but differ in emphasis, structure, and tooling.

## High-Level Summary

- **Purpose/Emphasis**
  - **mathematics-of-machine-learning-book-main**: Conceptual math foundations with strong visual intuition; “textbook chapter” style.
  - **ML-foundations-master**: Practical, hands-on ML coding and workflows; “workshop/notebook” style.

- **Organization**
  - **Book structure** by parts/chapters:
    - Examples: `mathematics-of-machine-learning-book-main/mathematics-of-machine-learning-book-main/part-01-linear-algebra/01-vectors-and-vector-spaces.py`, `part-02-functions/04-differentiation.py`, `part-04-probability-theory/02-random-variables-and-distributions.py`.
  - **Notebook series** focused on applied topics:
    - Examples: `ML-foundations-master/ML-foundations-master/notebooks/1-intro-to-linear-algebra.py`, `6-statistics.py`, `8-optimization.py`, plus demos like `regression-in-pytorch.py`, `SGD-from-scratch.py`.

## Topics Coverage

- **Overlap**
  - Linear algebra, calculus, optimization, probability appear in both.

- **Differences in Emphasis**
  - **mathematics-of-machine-learning-book-main**
    - Conceptual/analytical treatment: distributions, entropy, convergence of sample averages, etc.
    - Examples:
      - Probability theory: `part-04-probability-theory/01-what-is-probability.py`, `02-random-variables-and-distributions.py`, `03-expected-value.py`.
      - Functions/Calculus: `part-02-functions/04-differentiation.py`, `05-optimization.py`.
      - Multivariable/Optimization: `part-03-multivariable-functions/03-optimization-in-multiple-variables.py`.
  - **ML-foundations-master**
    - Practical ML workflows and implementations; from-scratch optimization and deep learning with PyTorch.
    - Examples:
      - Optimization & training dynamics: `gradient-descent-from-scratch.py`, `learning-rate-scheduling.py`, `SGD-from-scratch.py`.
      - Neural networks & PyTorch: `artificial-neurons.py`, `regression-in-pytorch.py`.
      - Classical ML workflows: `7-algos-and-data-structures.py` with train/test splits and models.

## Library Usage

- **PyTorch**
  - **ML-foundations-master**: Heavy use of `torch` (e.g., `1-intro-to-linear-algebra.py`, `3-calculus-i.py`, `learning-rate-scheduling.py`, `SGD-from-scratch.py`, `regression-in-pytorch.py`).
  - **mathematics-of-machine-learning-book-main**: No PyTorch usage detected.

- **NumPy**
  - Used extensively in both repos for arrays, numerical routines, and simple simulations.
  - Examples:
    - Book: `part-04-probability-theory/03-expected-value.py`, `part-02-functions/04-differentiation.py`.
    - ML Foundations: `6-statistics.py`, `8-optimization.py`, `7-algos-and-data-structures.py`.

- **Matplotlib**
  - Used in both for visualization.
  - Book often uses style contexts for polished visuals: `with plt.style.context("seaborn-v0_8")` (e.g., `part-04-probability-theory/03-expected-value.py`).
  - ML Foundations uses straightforward plotting in teaching workflows.

- **scikit-learn**
  - **ML-foundations-master**: Extensive use for classical ML (PCA, trees, ensembles, metrics, splits).
    - Examples: `from sklearn.decomposition import PCA` in `2-linear-algebra-ii.py`, `DecisionTreeClassifier` / `RandomForestClassifier` / `train_test_split` in `7-algos-and-data-structures.py`, `auc` in `4-calculus-ii.py`.
  - **Book**: Minimal, mostly datasets for illustration (e.g., `from sklearn.datasets import load_iris` in `part-01-linear-algebra/01-vectors-and-vector-spaces.py`).

- **SciPy**
  - Both use SciPy for probability and numerical methods.
  - Book: rich coverage of distributions (e.g., `bernoulli`, `binom`, `geom`, `uniform`, `expon`, `norm`) in `part-04-probability-theory/02-random-variables-and-distributions.py`, and expected value demos in `03-expected-value.py`.
  - ML Foundations: `scipy.stats` for probability (`5-probability.py`, `6-statistics.py`) and numerical integration in `4-calculus-ii.py`.

## Pedagogical Style

- **mathematics-of-machine-learning-book-main**
  - Chapter-based narrative focusing on mathematical definitions, intuition, and properties.
  - Extensive didactic plots (entropy curves, distribution shapes, convergence visuals).

- **ML-foundations-master**
  - Workshop/notebook style emphasizing implementation practice, code-first explanations, and ML pipeline usage (splits, metrics, model fitting).

## Code Structure and Patterns

- Both repositories were originally notebooks (now also available as `.py` after conversion), resulting in procedural code blocks with visualization.
- Book repo includes occasional type hints around numeric arrays (e.g., `np.array` annotations in `part-03-multivariable-functions/03-optimization-in-multiple-variables.py`).
- Book repo commonly applies Matplotlib style contexts (e.g., `with plt.style.context("seaborn-v0_8")`).
- ML Foundations repo interweaves visualization with data processing, modeling, and evaluation pipelines, often using `torch` and `sklearn`.

## Representative File Examples

## Takeaways

- Choose the **Book** repo when you want conceptual depth, rigorous math framing, and polished visual intuition.
- Choose the **ML Foundations** repo when you want practical, code-centric learning with PyTorch and scikit-learn, including end-to-end workflows.

If you’d like, I can add a summary table of topic/library counts, or extract side-by-side code snippets (e.g., optimization) to highlight stylistic differences.
